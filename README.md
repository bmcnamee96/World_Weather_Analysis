# World Weather Analysis

## Overview
Using gmaps and API data from Google Maps and Open Weather Map we were able to look at current weather data around the world.

### US Trip
By filtering the data using a minimum temperature of 70*F and a maximum temperature of 90*F we were able to find a cross country tour of the United States.  The 4 cities that we traveled to are Virginia Beach (VA), Seminole (FL), Morro Bay (CA), and Ukiah (CA).
